It is possible to start reccuring callback execution or set bunch of delayed callback executions at one.

For this reason special class modifier `PERIOD` is using

`PERIOD` take 2 optional arguments `at_time` and `interval` but only one of them is allowed to be provided.

- `at_time` - take one timestamp or list of timestamps. They all should be timestamps related to UTC time.

For instance lets consider you want to execute remote callback `my_callback` 3 times, After 2 seconds after 10 seconds and after a minute:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from daffi import Global, PERIOD

g = Global(host="localhost", port=8888)

# Wait my_callback function to be available on remote
g.wait_function("my_callback")

now = datetime.utcnow().timestamp()

# 2 sec, 10 sec and 60 sec later
at_time = [now + 2, now + 10, now + 60]

task = g.call.some_func() & PERIOD(at_time=at_time)
```

Execution with `PERIOD` modifier returns `ScheduledTask` instance as result of execution.

You can cancel all tasks triggered from this task:
```python
...
at_time = [now + 2, now + 10, now + 60]
task = g.call.some_func() & PERIOD(at_time=at_time)

... # do smth
time.sleep(3)
task.cancel()
```

As we slept 3 seconds before canceling only two executions that remains in `at_time` bunch will be canceled as first of them was already triggered earlier.


Using `interval` has the same execution signature and also returns instance of `ScheduledTask` as result so you can cancel reccuring task any time you want

```python
import time
from datetime import datetime
from daffi import Global, PERIOD

g = Global(host="localhost", port=8888)

# Wait my_callback function to be available on remote
g.wait_function("my_callback")

now = datetime.utcnow().timestamp()

# Execute remote callback `some_func` each 5 seconds
task = g.call.some_func() & PERIOD(interval=5)

time.sleep(60)
task.cancel()
```

On example above we started reccuring execution each 5 second and canceled it after sleep

!!! note
    interval also takes special string formatted expressions as values
    for instance next statement is also valid:
    
    ```python
    task = g.call.some_func() & PERIOD(interval="5s")
    ```
    
    Another examples:
    
    '1m24s'       ==  84 seconds
    
    '1.2 minutes' == 72 seconds
