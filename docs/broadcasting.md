It is possible to register callback with the same name on many nodes.

Let's consider we have the following callback registered on nodes with names `node-1`, `node-2` and `node-3`

```python
from daffi import Global, callback

proc_name = "node-<1, 2, 3>" # node-1, node-2 or node-3 depends on node

@callback
def my_callback(some_string: str) -> str:
    return some_string + "-" + proc_name


g = Global() # Connection via UNIX socket
g.join()
```


After that we can trigger broadcast remote call from node-4:

```python
from daffi import Global, BROADCAST

proc_name = "node-4"


g = Global(init_controller=True)

# Wait all processes to start
for proc in ("node-1", "node-2", "node-3"):
    g.wait_process(proc)

result = g.call.my_callback(some_string="abc") & BROADCAST(return_result=True)

print(result)
```

You should see the following output:

```json
{
"node-1":  "abc-node-1",
"node-2":  "abc-node-2",
"node-3":  "abc-node-3"
}
```

Where keys of dictionary are referred to node names where result was calculated and values represents calculated 
results respectively.  


One can also use method instead of execution modifier class. For instance following statement has the same effect:

```python
result = g.call.my_callback(some_string="abc").broadcast(return_result=True)
```
